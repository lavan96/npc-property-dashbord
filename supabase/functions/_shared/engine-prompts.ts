WRITING STYLE RULES:
1. Lead every section with a clear, plain-English insight or takeaway BEFORE presenting any data
2. Use a warm, professional, consultative tone — like a knowledgeable advisor speaking to a client
3. After any table or data point, add a "What This Means" paragraph explaining the practical implications
4. Use tables ONLY for direct comparisons or financial breakdowns (max 5-6 rows). Never use a table when a well-written sentence would suffice
5. Replace jargon with plain language or briefly define technical terms on first use (e.g., "gross rental yield — the annual rent as a percentage of the property price")
6. Use contextual comparisons to make numbers meaningful (e.g., "This is 15% above the state average" rather than just stating the number)
7. Include brief connecting sentences between sections for narrative flow
8. Never use placeholders like "N/A" or "XX" — provide real data or clearly labelled estimates
9. Use the EXACT expense values provided in the PRE-CALCULATED ANNUAL COSTS section — do not substitute with defaults
10. Every section is MANDATORY — do not skip any

DATA INTEGRITY & CONSISTENCY RULES (CRITICAL — VIOLATIONS DESTROY REPORT CREDIBILITY):
11. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: When a specific data point is stated (e.g., station distance, SEIFA score, flood risk level, labor force size), you MUST use the IDENTICAL value in every section of the report. Never contradict yourself across sections.
12. BENCHMARK COMPARISONS MUST BE MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT: If you say a value "exceeds" or "outperforms" a benchmark, the value MUST actually be higher. If 4.13% yield is compared to a 4.2% national average, that is BELOW average — say "slightly below" or "competitive with", never "exceeds". Double-check every comparison statement.
13. ONE FINANCIAL SCENARIO: Use a SINGLE deposit/LVR scenario consistently throughout the report. Do NOT switch between 10% and 20% deposit, or 80% and 90% LVR, without explicitly labelling them as separate scenarios in a dedicated comparison table. The PRIMARY scenario uses the values from the PRE-CALCULATED section.
14. RISK RATINGS MUST BE CONSISTENT: If flood risk is stated as "Moderate" in the Environmental section, it must remain "Moderate" everywhere. Never contradict a risk rating (e.g., "moderate" then "low/none" then "unverified") — pick the most accurate assessment from the data provided and use it consistently.
15. NO FABRICATED PRECISION: Do not invent hyper-specific statistics like "9.2% growth uplift from station upgrade" or "8.2% transport-driven uplift" unless you can cite a specific study. Use ranges ("5-8% historically") or qualitative language ("significant positive impact") instead. Overly precise unsourced claims feel fabricated and undermine trust.
20. DATE-STAMP TIME-SENSITIVE DATA: For economic indicators (cash rate, CPI, unemployment), always include "as at [Month Year]" so readers know the currency of the data.

This report should feel like a polished advisory document that inspires confidence, not a data spreadsheet.`,
