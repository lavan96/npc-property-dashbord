-- Docling terminal-state normalizer v5.
--
-- Production audit (2026-07-14) found three record classes the v4 watchdog and
-- the nightly GC never normalize, leaving the backend records permanently
-- inconsistent with the Docling sidecar terminal-state contract
-- (terminal-state-normalizer-v1):
--
--   1. Chunked jobs whose chunks stall in 'pending'/'dispatched'/'parsing':
--      v4 Pass 2 deliberately skips chunked jobs while ANY chunk is in flight,
--      so a chunk that never gets a callback pins its job in 'queued' forever
--      (2 jobs were stuck 13 days).
--   2. 'recoverable_failed' jobs are excluded from every sweep by design, but
--      the diagnostics bucket GC deletes their source artifacts after 7 days —
--      after that a retry is impossible and the row should be terminally
--      'failed' (9 rows were 3–4 weeks old).
--   3. template_imports rows stuck in 'processing': nothing sweeps this table
--      at all. When the browser closes mid-poll or the finalize worker dies,
--      the import row misreports as in-progress forever (16 rows, oldest > 1
--      month).
--
-- v5 keeps v4's Pass 1 and Pass 2 unchanged and adds Passes 3–5 for the
-- classes above. The final SELECT runs one sweep immediately as the one-time
-- repair for the existing stuck records.

-- Pass 5 support: cheap partial index for the template_imports sweep.
