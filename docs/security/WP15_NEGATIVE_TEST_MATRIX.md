# WP-15 — Runtime Negative-Test Matrix

Source: `NPC_Property_Dashboard_Codex_Security_Implementation_Plan.md` §22.4.

Every row below must be executed against the **deployed** environment (not
localhost, not staging-of-staging). Each test produces one JSON line:

```json
{"id":"NT-01","target":"market-ai","input":"alg=none JWT","expected":"401","observed":"401","result":"expected_denial"}
```

Store results at `docs/security/wp15-evidence/<date>/negative-tests.jsonl`.
`result` must be `expected_denial` on every row. Anything else blocks launch.

## Automation hooks

The negative-test runner lives at `scripts/security/wp15-negative-tests.mjs`
(to be added by the QA owner). It reads `WP15_NEGATIVE_TEST_MATRIX.md` inline
IDs and posts each request via `fetch()` with expected status codes.
