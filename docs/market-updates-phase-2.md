# Market Updates Phase 2

## Purpose
Market Updates is a source-backed Australian property market intelligence workspace for finance, property market, construction/supply, rental, policy/regulation and economic updates. It never displays fake news: cards, KPIs, digests and Q&A are derived from persisted Supabase records.

## Tables
Run `supabase/migrations/20260703000000_market_updates_phase_2.sql` to create `market_sources`, `market_updates`, `market_digests` and `market_update_questions` with indexes and RLS.

## Edge Functions
- `market-updates-ingest`: protected ingestion from enabled `market_sources`.
- `market-updates-digest`: protected 24-hour digest from published stored updates.
- `market-updates-qa`: authenticated, source-grounded Q&A from published stored updates only.

## Environment variables
- `MARKET_INGESTION_CRON_SECRET` for cron/admin execution.
- `MARKET_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD` defaults to `60`.
- `MARKET_AI_MODEL` for future source-grounded summarisation model selection.
- `MARKET_NEWS_API_KEY` if a licensed news API adapter is configured.
- `MARKET_DATA_API_KEY` if a licensed property data adapter is configured.
- AI provider key following existing repo conventions, e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, only in Supabase Edge Functions.
- Supabase function runtime variables: `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

## Seeding sources
Seed disabled candidates from `src/services/marketUpdates/sourceSeeds.ts`. Keep sources disabled until licensing, usage terms and feed quality are verified. Example: insert rows into `market_sources` with `enabled = false`, review, then enable.

## Manual ingestion
Call `market-updates-ingest` with `x-cron-secret: $MARKET_INGESTION_CRON_SECRET` and optional body `{ "force": true }`. The function loads enabled sources, respects `refresh_frequency_hours` unless forced, normalises feed items, deduplicates, scores relevance, classifies, and stores rows.

## Digest generation
Call `market-updates-digest` after ingestion using an authenticated session or cron secret. It queries published updates from the last 24 hours and writes one `market_digests` row. If no records exist it returns the truthful no-data response.

## Q&A testing
Call `market-updates-qa` as an authenticated user with `{ "question": "...", "updateIds": ["optional-id"] }`. It refuses unsupported questions with: “I do not have enough sourced market updates to answer that yet.”

## Daily automation
Schedule `market-updates-ingest` every 24 hours, then schedule `market-updates-digest` after ingestion. The page reads the latest digest and published updates on load.

## Security
No service-role key, AI key or private data provider key is used in the browser. Ingestion and digest are protected. Q&A requires authentication. Public unauthenticated writes are blocked by RLS.

## Copyright and citations
Store short excerpts and metadata only unless licensed. Published updates require source URLs and citations. Summaries must be concise, transformative and grounded in supplied source material.

## Known limitations
RSS support intentionally limits items and does not scrape full article pages. API and partner-feed adapters require licensed server-side configuration. Model/API usage logging should be wired into the project-wide metering pipeline when market operations are enabled in production.
