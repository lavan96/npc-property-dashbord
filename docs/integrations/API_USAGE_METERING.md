# API usage metering — this deployment may be spending someone else's money

## The situation

A workspace provisioned by **Aurixa Mission Control** is a clone of this repo's
Supabase architecture, and it boots with the prime's own vendor keys forwarded
into its project: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `DOMAIN_API_KEY`,
`COTALITY_API_KEY`, `LOVABLE_API_KEY` and the rest. That is what stops every
edge function 500-ing on a secret shell on day one.

It also means every model token, transactional email and property lookup that
workspace makes is billed to the *prime's* vendor accounts. Mission Control
recharges it per tenant. A workspace that supplies its own key for a given
secret costs the prime nothing for that key and is charged nothing for it.

**The prime install itself is never charged** — a tenant with no clone is
Mission Control's own project. Nothing here changes what this repo costs to run
in its home deployment; it makes the same calls attributable when the code is
running somewhere else.

## What this repo contributes

Nothing decides billing here. This repo's job is to say *what was consumed and
on which credential*; Mission Control decides whose key it was, from its own
record of what it forwarded.

| file | role |
|---|---|
| `_shared/logApiUsage.ts` | already writes every metered call to `api_usage_log` — unchanged, and still the only place call sites touch |
| `_shared/meteredFetch.ts` | drop-in `fetch` that resolves the credential from the URL and meters the call |
| `_shared/apiUsageBilling.pure.ts` | `service_name` and vendor host → the secret name spent, and what one unit of it is. Pure, tested |
| `report-api-usage/` | cron worker that drains the queue into Mission Control |
| `_shared/missionControl.ts` | `reportApiUsage()` — the only place that talks to the metering API |
| migration `…_api_usage_mission_control_forwarding.sql` | the queue columns and the claim/mark RPCs |

## Why a worker and not an inline call

Metering on the request path puts a network hop in front of a client's report to
buy a billing nicety, and loses the call outright whenever Mission Control is
slow. Rows queue in `api_usage_log` instead and `report-api-usage` drains them in
batches of 200, so an outage delays revenue rather than destroying it.

The **row id is the idempotency key**. The worker retries; without a stable key
a re-sent batch would meter the same calls twice. Mission Control dedupes on
`(tenant, idempotency_key)` and returns the original rating.

## The queue

`api_usage_log` gained four columns:

- `mc_reported_at` — NULL means still queued
- `mc_attempts` — at 5 the row leaves the partial index and needs an operator
- `mc_last_error`
- `mc_billing_reason` — Mission Control's verdict: `inherited` (billed), `byok`,
  `no_key`, `unknown_secret`, `not_billable`, `error_call`, `rate_missing`

`api_usage_forwarding_status()` gives pending / stuck / reported / billed /
own-key / unbillable counts and the oldest pending row.

`claim_api_usage_for_forwarding()` deliberately narrows what the worker can read
to the fields metering needs — `api_usage_log` carries request metadata that has
no business leaving this project. Rows older than 30 days are skipped: Mission
Control will not accept them, so retrying them forever is pure waste.

Claim and mark are separate RPCs so a partial failure marks only what actually
landed. An all-or-nothing update would either re-bill the accepted rows or
silently drop the rejected ones.

## Adding a vendor

Two rules, both cheap to get wrong:

1. **`service_name` must be in the map.** `apiUsageBilling.pure.ts` resolves
   `service_name` → secret name. It is deliberately explicit — no fuzzy
   matching, no "closest key" fallback. An unmapped service is metered here and
   **never billed**, because guessing bills the wrong tenant, which is worse
   than not billing. Aliases are handled (`ghl` / `gohighlevel`, `lovable-ai` /
   `lovable-ai-gateway`), but a new vendor needs a real entry.

2. **Or name the credential at the call site.** `metadata: { secret_name:
   "OPENROUTER_API_KEY" }` wins over the map. That is how a new vendor gets
   billed before this file learns about it.

Then add a matching row to Mission Control's `api_provider_rates`, or the call
lands as `rate_missing` on its dashboard.

`service_name` is a vendor, not a credential: `google-maps` and `google-ai` are
the same vendor and separate bills. Keep them apart.

## Metering it is not the same as being worth spending

Metering answers *who pays*. It does not ask whether the call needed making,
and the two get conflated because a correctly-metered call looks entirely
healthy on the dashboard.

Builder Stock is the worked example. Its stage-2 and stage-3 image enrichment
spend three Google calls (geocode, Street View metadata, the image) and one
Perplexity call per property, all correctly metered. They ran unconditionally
for every property with no builder photograph — and once imports began
re-queueing every item they touched, importing the same stock list a second
time bought the same pictures a second time. On the 70-property Notion list
that is ~280 vendor calls to reach an answer already on the row, and under the
strict display rule (`primaryImage.ts`) none of that imagery can ever appear on
a card, so not one of those calls could change what a client sees.

The rule is `_shared/builderStock/enrichmentRetry.pure.ts`, and it is worth
copying rather than the alternative that suggests itself:

> A paid stage runs again when it has never answered, when its last answer was
> about **us** rather than about the subject, or when the **input** it answered
> for has changed. Otherwise the recorded answer stands.

**Not a cache expiry.** A TTL is a number nobody can justify. "The key was
missing", "the kill switch was on", "the circuit was open", "the ceiling was
reached", "the request failed" are statements about this deployment at a
moment — fix the key and the honest thing is to ask again. "This address has no
Street View coverage", "nothing published was found" are statements about the
subject, and the same input buys the same answer. So the reason is **classified
and recorded** on the row (`stage_reason`) alongside the input it answered for
(`stage_input`); matching on the human-readable message would have worked until
somebody improved the wording.

Two details that keep it honest. Membership is tested against the **settled**
set, so anything unrecognised — a future reason, a typo, the absent reason on a
row written before this existed — falls to "ask again": being wrong that way
costs one call, being wrong the other way costs a picture for ever and nothing
reports it. And a **changed input outranks an artefact already in hand**,
because a Street View bought for a corrected address is a photograph of the
wrong house.

## `meteredFetch` — how a call gets metered now

Instrumenting by hand meant a rule ("remember to log") that decays the moment
somebody adds the next function, and one chance per call site to attribute the
spend to the wrong credential. `_shared/meteredFetch.ts` wraps the thing the
author was already writing instead:

```ts
import { meteredFetch } from "../_shared/meteredFetch.ts";

const res = await meteredFetch("https://api.resend.com/emails", init);
```

That is the whole change. The URL already says which credential it spends, so
`secretForUrl` resolves it; token-priced vendors have their token count read off
the response via `clone()` so the caller's body is untouched; the log write is
fire-and-forget and cannot fail the call that earns the revenue. It builds its
own service-role client from env, so no plumbing reaches the call site.

Two rules it cannot infer for you:

- **Self-hosted sidecars need an explicit credential.** WeasyPrint, the PDF
  parser and the AML service take their URL from env and have no fixed host, so
  they pass `{ secretName: "WEASYPRINT_SERVICE_TOKEN" }`.
- **A request that consumes more than one unit must say so.** One Resend call
  can send 50 emails; pass `{ quantity: 50 }`.

Never add `meteredFetch` to a call site that already calls `logApiUsage` for the
same request — that bills the tenant twice, which is worse than not billing.

## Instrumentation coverage

Coverage bounds everything: a call that never reaches `logApiUsage` or
`meteredFetch` is invisible to the meter, and the billing dashboard can only
show what it was told about.

| | edge functions metered |
|---|---|
| Before | 27 of 413 |
| After the sweep | **61 of 413** |

The sweep converted 51 direct vendor `fetch` calls across 38 functions, plus two
shared clients that cover many routes at once — `weasyprintClient.ts` (all
eleven PDF render routes) and the PDF-parse sidecar dispatcher.

### Model calls: metered at the router, opt-out at the caller

`_shared/llmRouter.ts` is the choke point for the gateway, OpenAI, Anthropic,
Perplexity, OpenRouter and Gemini, and it now meters every call it makes.

Measured before the change: **25 edge functions call `callLLM`/`callLLMRaw`, and
19 of them never logged anything** — including `report-qa`,
`parse-template-document` and `vapi-call-webhook`, whose only `logApiUsage`
calls turned out to be for embeddings or a different vendor entirely. Those were
spending a forwarded key for free.

Exactly **6 functions log adjacently to their own call** and would otherwise be
billed twice, which is worse than not billing. They opt out explicitly:

| function | call sites opted out |
|---|---|
| `email-copilot` | 7 |
| `clean-note-transcript` | 1 |
| `generate-chart-analysis` | 1 |
| `estimate-property-expenses` | 1 |
| `parse-property-pdf` | 2 |
| `format-comparison-report` | 1 |

The flag is `meterUsage`, and it **defaults to true** — the whole liability was
silence, so an omitted flag must never mean unbilled. `email-copilot` has an
eighth `callLLM` with no adjacent logging; it is deliberately NOT opted out.

Which credential a call spent is resolved by
`_shared/llmUsageBinding.pure.ts`, which mirrors the router's own `(route,
modelId)` dispatch. An unrecognised model family returns **null**, and the
router then logs nothing and warns — a `service_name` the map does not know is
metered and never billed, and a wrong one bills the wrong tenant. A CI test
reads the router's source and fails if a new `modelId.startsWith(...)` branch
appears that the resolver cannot bind.

`template-design-agent` does not go through the router: it calls the Anthropic
Messages API directly via `_shared/claudeReconstruct.ts`, which meters
unconditionally against `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

The remaining uninstrumented functions that touch a billable credential are
those whose vendor URL is assembled from a variable the sweep could not resolve
statically.

## Deployment

- `verify_jwt = false` in `config.toml`; the function authenticates itself with
  `INTERNAL_EDGE_SECRET` or the cron secret, constant-time compared. It reads a
  billing queue and is never public.
- Registered `cron-worker` in `functions-registry/SECURITY_REGISTRY.json`.
- Schedule it hourly via pg_cron with `x-internal-edge-secret`. Frequency only
  affects how fresh Mission Control's dashboard is; a missed run costs nothing
  because the queue drains on the next one.
- Requires `MISSION_CONTROL_URL` and `MISSION_CONTROL_CLONE_API_KEY`, and that
  key must carry the **`usage:report`** scope. Without the scope the worker
  gets 401s, the retry counter burns out, and nothing is ever billed — silently.
