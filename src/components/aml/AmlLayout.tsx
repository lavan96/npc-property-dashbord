/**
 * AML shell navigation.
 *
 * Ships two navigation configurations:
 *
 *  - **Legacy (V2, default)** — the five-workspace shell delivered in V2, kept
 *    byte-identical for tenants who have not yet enabled the V3 nav flag.
 *  - **V3** — activated by `feature_flags.aml_v3_nav = true`. Applies
 *    Directives 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 from the Version 3 report:
 *      · Directive 2 — Customer Compliance is limited to Cases + My Queue.
 *        Verification, Screening, Risk, Structures and Finance handoff move
 *        inside the case workspace (built in Phase 4/6). Legacy URLs remain
 *        live via aliases in `src/App.tsx`.
 *      · Directive 3 — "Structures" is renamed "Ownership & Control" in the
 *        (transaction) counterparty entry.
 *      · Directive 4 — "Finance handoff" is renamed "Funding & Finance"
 *        wherever the legacy label still surfaces.
 *      · Directive 7 — "Platform Administration" is renamed
 *        "Organisation Settings".
 *      · Directive 8 — the tenant-facing Plans & Entitlements surface is
 *        withdrawn from workspace navigation.
 *
 * Server-side permission checks continue to run inside each route via
 * `AmlGuard`; this shell only decides what appears in the primary and
 * secondary nav.
